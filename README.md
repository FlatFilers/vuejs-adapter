We've made it really simple for you to get started with Flatfile with our new Flatfile Component. Here's what you'll need to know to get started.

First, install the dependency via npm:

`npm install @flatfile/vuejs`

This will give you access to the `<FlatfileButton />` component as well as the same basic functionality as our Adapter.
